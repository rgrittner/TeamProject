# Team Project - Renee, Nicole, Xinan

### Problem Statement
There are many ways to display Java Objects on web pages. Some of the common practices includes using JSTL or Scriptlets in JSP.
However, Many front-end web applications use JSON or XML, which makes it difficult for Java Developers to utilize these front-end applications.
We would like to create an API that allows you to convert Java Objects to JSON or XML. It will allow you to easily display Java Objects with Angular or
other front-end web applications, and make your web page looks more professional and clean.
